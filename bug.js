This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native with an object or array as the initial state.  If you directly mutate the state object or array, React won't detect the change, and the UI won't update.  The problem stems from the fact that React's state updates are shallow comparisons, meaning it checks if the reference to the state object has changed, not the content of the object itself.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
const [count, setCount] = useState({ count: 0 });

setCount({ ...count, count: count.count + 1 }); //React won't detect this change
```
